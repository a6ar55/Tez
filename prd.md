Product Name:
Tez (working title) â€” Instant Local File Sharing Web App

Purpose:
Tez enables fast, secure, and reliable file transfer between devices over a Local Area Network (LAN). This web app is designed as a cross-platform, airdrop-like alternative for any desktop or mobile device running a modern browser or Electron app.

1. Goals & Objectives
Provide seamless, fast LAN file transfer without the need for an internet connection.

Offer strong security through end-to-end encryption and device authentication.

Deliver a frictionless, cross-platform UX (macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS).

Support large file sizes and resumable transfers.

2. Key Features
Peer Discovery: Devices auto-detect others on the LAN via mDNS/UDP broadcast/WebRTC.

High-Speed File Transfer: P2P transfers over TCP, WebRTC DataChannel, or HTTP2.

Resumable Chunked Transfer: Pause/retry failed transfers; transfer very large files.

Multi-device: Send to multiple devices simultaneously.

End-to-End Encryption: Secure handshake, session keys, encrypted transfer.

Device Authentication: Optional pre-approved device lists or in-session numeric pairing code.

Transfer Dashboard: Real-time status, speed, ETA, and history.

Cross-Platform: React web + Electron desktop, mobile web PWA support.

Content Scanning: Malware/PII scan prior to sending.

Analytics & Logs: Per-device transfer stats and error reporting.

Advanced Settings: Network selection, fallback protocol, bandwidth limits, dark/light themes.

3. Non-Goals
No support for internet-based transfers (strictly local for MVP).

No cloud storage.

4. Personas
Tech-savvy home users (wants to transfer large media files)

Enterprise employees (quick document sharing in secure environments)

Developers (sharing build artifacts without uploading to cloud)

5. Success Criteria
Transfer 5GB file between two devices on LAN < 5 minutes.

Each device correctly lists all others on the same network within 10 seconds.

No data leaks or unauthorized device transfers (verified by audit).

Smooth experience across Chrome, Edge, Safari, Electron.

6. User Stories
As a user, I can see all available devices on my Wi-Fi and select one or multiple to send files.

As a user, I am prompted to accept/decline incoming transfers.

As a user, I see exactly which files are being sent, with live progress.

As an admin, I can whitelist devices allowed to send to/receive from my machine.

As a user, I know my transfers are secure from sniffing/unauthorized access.

7. Technical Requirements
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB (optional for logs/history), Socket.io, Electron (optional), Multer (file handling), dgram/mdns/WebRTC.

Security: End-to-end encryption, device authentication (code/QR/OAuth).

Performance: Support at least 20MBps+ transfers, 100+ concurrent sessions.

Resilience: Resume failed transfers, handle network disconnects.

Scalability: Modular backend, plugin-ready discovery and transfer engines.

8. Risks & Mitigations
Browser restrictions: May need Electron/native app for full LAN/mDNS support.

File permissions: Must handle browser sandbox and filesystem APIs safely.

Security: Rigorous encryption and handshake audits, strong device pairing protocol.

9. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
Fallback to WAN with relay server for remote transfers.

Integration with third-party apps (Google Drive, Slack, etc.).

Advanced analytics dashboards, enterprise SSO support.
