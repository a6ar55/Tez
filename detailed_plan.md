## Tips for Implementation

### Start Simple
- Begin with basic file transfer without encryption
- Add security features incrementally
- Test each component thoroughly before moving forward

### Focus on Core Flow
- Prioritize the main use case: device discovery → pairing → file transfer
- Add advanced features after core functionality works

### Use Incremental Development
- Build and test each stage independently
- Create comprehensive unit tests for each component
- Use version control effectively with feature branches

### Documentation
- Document APIs as you build them
- Keep architecture decisions recorded
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

This roadmap will give you a comprehensive understanding of building a complex, real-time, networked application while learning the intricacies of each component.
